# Touch√© Young has three auditors. Each can work as many as 160 hours during the next
# month, during which time three projects must be completed. Project 1 will take 130 hours;
# project 2, 140 hours; and project 3, 160 hours. The amount per hour that can be billed for
# assigning each auditor to each project is given in the table below. Formulate a balanced
# transportation problem to maximize total billings during the next month.
